#The analysis shows that individuals who do not monitor their calorie intake tend to consume more high-calorie foods across all age groups and genders. Middle-aged adults, especially females, benefit the most from calorie monitoring, as they are more likely to avoid high-calorie foods. Younger and older individuals show less impact from calorie monitoring, suggesting they may need other strategies for effective dietary interventions. Promoting calorie awareness, particularly for middle-aged adults and females, could help reduce high-calorie food consumption.
